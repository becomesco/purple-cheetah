Purple Cheetah is a lightweight framework written in Typescript and ExpressJS, meant for building Web APIs (REST and GraphQL). You are probably thinking: Not another javascript framework! And we agree with you. Purple Cheetah was developed to resolve issues in our company and give us tool with small amount of external dependencies. Simply put, Purple Cheetah is not a general purpose framework like NestJS, but because of this, it is small and fast.
